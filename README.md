ist project calculator.
<br>
in calcuator project i used to make diffrent method/function for every
<br>
seprate result.like i create the sum function for plus i make divide 
<br>function and many moer function i take two number input from the user 
<br>and then i take a number as a operator like if the user press the 
<br>button 1 sum function will call  and print the sum of two given number<br>same like i take other number for other funtion between 1 and 7.
<br>every function perfoam some diffrent value and print their result 
<br>acccording to their instructions.
<br>i make the program like if user want to stop after some expression <br>they can brake the program and go out from the program but if the user <br>want to stay inside the program and continue their application of <br>calculator again and again for that purpose i use while true condition.
<br>i used a module with "math" name to find exponent  and sqareroot of <br>the value.
<br>expoenent will take of 2 and the input number will be thw power of <br>that 2 like if i take input  99 and 3 than my function will take the <br>power of 2 power 99+3 and will find the exponent.
<br>i handled the vlaueError in calculator where user enter wrong value
<br> there will e raise value error and program got skipped. for one whole <br>loop
